Overview
--------
Cryptic is a machine learning trading research system for BTC-USD using
walk-forward validation, realistic transaction costs, and IC testing.

Current Status
--------------
- Strategy Return: +69.27%
- Sharpe Ratio: +8.07
- Max Drawdown: -24.53%
- IC: +0.7201 (p=0.0125) - statistically significant
- Test Periods: 11

Key Architecture
----------------
1) Data: Yahoo Finance (BTC-USD OHLCV)
2) Features: 11 momentum/mean-reversion/volatility features
3) Model: RF + XGB ensemble (equal weights)
4) Backtest: Walk-forward with retrain frequency
5) Risk: Position sizing, leverage caps, transaction costs, stop loss

Production Readiness
--------------------
PASS:
- No lookahead bias
- No data leakage
- Statistical signal (IC positive, p < 0.05)
- Risk controls in place

CAUTION:
- Limited test periods (11). More samples improve confidence.
- Single asset (BTC). Generalization unproven.

Deployment Checklist
--------------------
1) Run backtest: python main.py
2) Validate IC: must be positive and p < 0.05
3) Verify drawdown: must be > -30%
4) Review dashboard: results/dashboard.png
5) Run tests: pytest -q

Runbook
-------
- Start dashboard:
  streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
- Tune parameters and re-run backtest
- Save presets for reproducibility (ui/presets/presets.json)

If You Trade Live
-----------------
- Add real-time data feed and broker integration
- Add alerting and monitoring
- Use strict risk limits and position caps
- Paper trade before deployment
